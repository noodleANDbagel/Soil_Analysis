Data-Driven Soil Analysis and Evaluation for Agriculture Using Machine Learning Approaches

The main goal of this project is to develop data-driven machine learning models to support soil analysis and evaluate the farmlands using satellite images and remote sensor data.

As machine learning and deep learning techniques advance, we incorporate these techniques into our soil analysis including crop identification, irrigation system recommendation, and fertilizer recommendation.

Classification machine learning models are deployed for crop identification system to classify different crop types. Random Forest with XGBoost provides the best performance with an 86.5% accuracy. The Linear Regression model with Lasso Regularizations is deployed for the irrigation system with 93.9% R-squared. For the fertilizer analysis, Multi-Layer Perceptron is used to find out the best performance with a 93.3% accuracy.
